## Problem

Aspiring data scientists need more than technical skills—they need to understand how to frame problems, communicate results, and work effectively in teams. Many bootcamp programs focus heavily on tools while underemphasizing the judgment and communication skills that determine success in industry roles.

## Approach

As an Associate Data Scientist and Instructor at Galvanize, I redesigned how we taught the applied components of the curriculum:

1. **Technical Instruction**: Led sessions on statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and code quality best practices
2. **Project Mentorship**: Guided students through capstone projects, emphasizing problem framing and stakeholder communication
3. **Assessment Design**: Created evaluation frameworks that measured not just technical accuracy but also communication clarity
4. **Ethics Integration**: Facilitated workshops on responsible AI and ethical data science practice

## Tools

- **Python** ecosystem (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow basics)
- **Statistical Methods** (hypothesis testing, regression, experimental design)
- **Instructional Design** principles for technical education
- **Assessment Frameworks** for measuring learning outcomes

## Impact

- Trained **25+ data scientists** who went on to industry roles
- Achieved **92% job placement rate** for program graduates
- Mentored **100+ students** through technical challenges and career transitions
- Improved **student retention by 15%** through curriculum and assessment redesign

  <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Teaching data science to career changers taught me that the best technical explanations start from the learner's existing mental models. This skill translates directly to stakeholder communication in industry settings.
