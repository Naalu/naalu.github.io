## Problem

New Zealand's Inland Revenue Department processed millions of tax records annually, but address data quality issues caused significant processing costs—incorrect addresses led to returned mail, delayed communications, and manual correction work.

## Approach

As an Implementation Consultant at Fast Enterprises, I designed and deployed an ML-based address validation system:

1. **Problem Scoping**: Worked with stakeholders to quantify the business impact of address errors
2. **Data Pipeline**: Built ETL processes to integrate with existing tax system infrastructure
3. **Model Development**: Trained models to detect invalid addresses, suggest corrections, and standardize formatting
4. **Deployment**: Integrated the system into production tax processing workflows
5. **Monitoring**: Established metrics to track ongoing accuracy and cost savings

## Tools

- **Python** for model development and data processing
- **SQL** for database integration
- **Production ML pipelines** integrated with enterprise tax software

## Impact

- **NZ$100,000+ in annual savings** through reduced manual corrections and returned mail
- **Improved data quality** across the national tax database
- System remained in production handling millions of records annually

  <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> This was my first experience building ML that runs in production at government scale. The technical challenge was real, but the bigger lesson was learning to translate complex policy requirements into technical specifications across international teams.
