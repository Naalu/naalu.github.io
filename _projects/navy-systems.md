## Problem

Nuclear propulsion systems generate continuous streams of sensor data that must be monitored for anomalies, analyzed for trends, and interpreted correctly under high-stakes conditions. The margin for error is zero.

## Approach

As an Engineering Laboratory Technician on the USS Henry M. Jackson (SSBN 730), I was responsible for:

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Analyzed time-series data from propulsion system sensors to detect anomalies
2. **Trend Analysis**: Identified patterns that could indicate developing issues before they became critical
3. **Training Development**: Created and delivered training programs to ensure consistent analytical standards across the team
4. **Documentation**: Maintained rigorous records for compliance and continuous improvement

## Impact

- **Improved qualification rates by 25%** through redesigned training programs
- Trained **50+ personnel** on analytical procedures and system monitoring
- Maintained **Secret clearance** and zero critical incidents
- Developed foundational skills in time-series analysis and high-stakes decision making

  <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> When the consequences of analytical errors are measured in lives rather than dollars, you learn to build robust processes, communicate clearly under pressure, and never cut corners on data quality.
