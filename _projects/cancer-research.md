## Problem

Healthcare researchers need rigorous statistical analyses to identify factors affecting patient outcomes, but many studies rely on simplistic methods that miss important relationships in complex clinical data.

## Approach

As a Graduate Research Student in NAU's Department of Mathematics & Statistics, I'm conducting advanced statistical research using R to analyze healthcare data. This work involves:

- Designing statistically sound study methodologies
- Implementing appropriate statistical models for complex healthcare outcomes
- Collaborating with domain experts to interpret results in clinical context
- Documenting findings for peer-reviewed publication

## Tools

- **R** (tidyverse, data.table, specialized statistical packages)
- **Git/GitHub** for version control and collaboration
- **LaTeX** for manuscript preparation
- **Microsoft Teams** for research collaboration

## Impact

- **First-author manuscript** currently under peer review in *Cancers*, a respected medical journal
- Maintained **CITI human subjects research certification** and responsible conduct of research certification
- Contributing to the evidence base for clinical decision-making
