# About Me

I'm a data scientist and statistician pursuing my Master's in Statistics at Northern Arizona University, where I'm also conducting peer-reviewed research in health services analytics. My work sits at the intersection of rigorous statistical methodology and practical machine learning—building models that don't just perform well on benchmarks, but create real-world impact.

## A Non-Traditional Path

My route to data science wasn't conventional, and I think that's one of my greatest strengths.

I started my career as a **nuclear engineering laboratory technician** on a U.S. Navy submarine, where I learned to monitor complex systems under high-stakes conditions, analyze time-series data from propulsion systems, and train teams to maintain operational excellence. That experience taught me something you can't learn in a classroom: when systems fail, the consequences are real—so your analysis had better be rigorous, your communication crystal clear, and your solutions battle-tested.

From the Navy, I moved into **government software consulting** at Fast Enterprises, implementing tax systems for agencies in New Zealand and across the United States. One project that still stands out: building an ML-based address validation system for New Zealand's tax authority that saved over NZ$100,000 annually. It was my first taste of how machine learning could solve real business problems at scale.

I formalized my data science skills through **Galvanize's Data Science Immersive**, then stayed on as an instructor and curriculum developer. Over two years, I trained 25+ data scientists and mentored more than 100 students, helping them land roles across the industry with a 92% placement rate. Teaching forced me to master not just the *how* of data science, but the *why*—and to explain complex concepts to people from every background imaginable.

## What I Bring

- **Systems thinking** from managing nuclear propulsion systems and government-scale software
- **Statistical rigor** from graduate-level coursework and active research
- **Production ML experience** from building systems that save real money
- **Communication skills** from training hundreds of aspiring data scientists
- **Healthcare domain expertise** from ongoing research and published work

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm deep in the weeds of:

- **Statistical research** in health services analytics (first-author manuscript under peer review in *Cancers*)
- **Advanced coursework** in mathematical statistics, deep learning, and time series analysis
- **Preparing for a concurrent MS in Computer Science** to strengthen my engineering foundations

I'm seeking data scientist and ML engineer roles where I can apply this blend of statistical depth, engineering discipline, and domain expertise—ideally in healthcare, public sector, or any organization that values rigorous, impactful work.
