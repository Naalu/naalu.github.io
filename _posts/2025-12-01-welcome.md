This site is new, and so is my commitment to writing publicly about what I'm learning.

For years, I taught data science to others but rarely documented my own learning process. That changes now. Here's why:

## Learning Through Explanation

Teaching at Galvanize taught me that explaining concepts to others is the fastest way to find gaps in your own understanding. The Feynman technique is real—if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

Writing serves the same purpose. When I try to articulate *why* a particular statistical method works, or *how* I approached a tricky feature engineering problem, I inevitably discover assumptions I hadn't examined.

## Building a Public Record

In data science hiring, portfolios matter more than credentials. But static project lists don't show how you think—they only show what you built.

Writing about the process—the dead ends, the surprises, the "aha" moments—gives potential collaborators and employers a window into my actual working style. That's harder to fake than a polished final product.

## What's Coming

Expect posts on:

- **Applied statistics** — methods I'm learning in my MS program, with practical examples
- **Healthcare analytics** — lessons from my research and domain-specific challenges
- **Teaching and communication** — how to explain complex ideas to different audiences
- **Tools and workflows** — practical tips for R, Python, and the data science stack

If any of this sounds interesting, stick around. And if you have questions or topics you'd like me to explore, [reach out](/contact/).
